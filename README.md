# HEAP-METRIC Phase-contrast MRI Manual

HEAP-METRIC Phase-contrast MRI is a novel MRI method to map low velocity flows such as CSF flow in the mouse brain. The HEAP-METRIC scheme is a novel generalized Hadamard encoding based approach for multi-band excitation, and it significantly boosts the imaging SNR per time of PC-MRI and allows fast and accurate mapping of low velocity flow.

This manual includes the Pulse Sequence pcHeapMetric Installation Manual and Reconstruction Tools Manual. The pulse sequence protocol and MRI data proccessing are provided in the PulseSequence file and ReconTools file, respectively. An example of MRI data is provided in the PulseSequence file for you to further understand HEAP-METRIC PC-MRI.
